	<p><strong>1. What is your element CSS class?</strong></p>
	<p>My element CSS classes are the following: h1.header and h4.header.</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>2. What is your global CSS class?</strong></p>
	<p>My global CSS classes are the following: body, p, h5, .header, .audiovideo, .table, .special_p and .links.</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>3. What are your HTML5-only tags?</strong></p>
	<p>My two HTML5-only tags are: &#60;audio> and &#60;video>.</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>4. What are your CSS3-only features?</strong></p>
	<p>My two CSS3-only features are: "text-shadow" and "box-shadow" </p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>5. Did you use the same protection method? If no, what did you use this time?</strong></p>
	<p>For this lab, I used a different and better method (The .htaccess method). In this lab I created a .htaccess file on my public_html folder and another file (.htpasswds) in another directory. The .htaccess file reaches out to the file that is not in the public_html folder and see the password and username set for it. When the index.html is called in public_html, the .htaccess will prompt and ask for a username and password, which the user cannot see, unlike the method used in the previous lab.</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>6. How long did you spend on this lab (approximately)?</strong></p>
	<p>It took me about 2 hrs to comlete the lab.</p>
