<p><strong>2. How did you password protect your page (what method)?</strong></p>
<p> There is no name for the method but the way I password protected my main page is through creating another page with JavaScript. This page has a key word/password set in the program and it prompts the user fot the password. If the user's input matches the pre-set password string insode the code, the page directs its self to the main page. If the user gets it wrong, he/she can enter it again with a total of 3 tries. If the input from the user is unmatched to the password in three tries, it exists the prompt</p>

<p><strong>3. What new tag did you try? What was its effect?</strong></p>
<p>A new tag that I tried and used was the video tag. The effect of the video tag was that I was able to put a video that I had downloaded from yutube and onto the site along with giving the user contro abilities.</p>


<p><strong>4.Does your page look different in different browsers and platforms(IE/Edge/Firefox/Chrome/Safari - desktop/tablet/phone)? If yes, what are the main differences?</strong></p>
<p>Most if the website is constants on different browsers. The only difference that can be found is that the font size seems to larger on chrome when on the phone, and when using Edge, the font is also bigger.</p>

<p><strong>5. How long did you spend on this lab (approximately)?</strong></p>
<p>The lab took me about 90 mins to finish.</p>
